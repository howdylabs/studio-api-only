This project will serve as a drop-in replacement for users of Botkit Studio.

Ideally, it will work in 2 ways:

* Users can require this module into their app and use it directly within botkit, replacing the botkit.studio commands with local versions

* Users can set up a microservice that replicates Botkit studio's apis and leave their app (mostly) unmodified.


TODO:

* support for fallback script
